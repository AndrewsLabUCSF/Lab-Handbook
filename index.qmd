# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Andrews Lab. As a member of our team, you are joining a group of dedicated researchers committed to advancing our understanding of the causal pathways that underly the development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias.

Our lab is a dynamic and collaborative environment where curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking are valued and nurtured. We believe that every member of our team brings unique perspectives and skills that enrich our research and contribute to our shared mission.

This handbook is designed to provide you with a comprehensive overview of our lab's operations, policies, and procedures. It serves as a guide to help you navigate your journey with us, whether you are a new member just starting out or an existing member seeking to refresh your knowledge.

In this handbook, you will find information about our lab's history, our team, the research we conduct, and the resources available to you. You will also find detailed protocols for our common procedures, guidelines for data management and authorship, and information about our ethical standards and compliance requirements.

We encourage you to read this handbook thoroughly and refer to it often. However, please remember that it is not meant to cover every possible scenario or answer every question. When in doubt, do not hesitate to ask. Open communication is key to our lab's success, and we are here to support you.

We are excited to have you on board and look forward to the contributions you will make to our lab. Together, we will continue to push the boundaries of genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics, making discoveries that have the potential to transform human health.

Welcome to our team!
