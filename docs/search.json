    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the Andrews Lab. As a member of our team, you are joining a group of dedicated researchers committed to advancing our understanding of the causal pathways that underly the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.\nOur lab is a dynamic and collaborative environment where curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking are valued and nurtured. We believe that every member of our team brings unique perspectives and skills that enrich our research and contribute to our shared mission.\nThis handbook is designed to provide you with a comprehensive overview of our lab’s operations, policies, and procedures. It serves as a guide to help you navigate your journey with us, whether you are a new member just starting out or an existing member seeking to refresh your knowledge.\nIn this handbook, you will find information about our lab’s history, our team, the research we conduct, and the resources available to you. You will also find detailed protocols for our common procedures, guidelines for data management and authorship, and information about our ethical standards and compliance requirements.\nWe encourage you to read this handbook thoroughly and refer to it often. However, please remember that it is not meant to cover every possible scenario or answer every question. When in doubt, do not hesitate to ask. Open communication is key to our lab’s success, and we are here to support you.\nWe are excited to have you on board and look forward to the contributions you will make to our lab. Together, we will continue to push the boundaries of genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics, making discoveries that have the potential to transform human health.\nWelcome to our team!\nShea Andrews\nPrincipal Investigator"

    "text": "Project Title\n\nBackground and Objective:\n\nProvide a clear statement about what is known about the topic. This should include a review of recent and relevant literature to the proposed research.\nIdentify gaps in the existing research or knowledge.\nDefine the specific problem or question the research will address.\nState the overall objective of your research. This should be a concise statement of what you hope to achieve with the research.\n\n\n\nPlanned analysis by Aims:\nBreak down the general research objective into specific aims. These should be clear, concrete goals that you will work towards throughout your research.\n\nAim 1:\n\nDefine the first specific aim of your research. This should be a clear, measurable goal that directly contributes to your overall research objective.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nFormulate a hypothesis for Aim 1. This should be a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to find in your research.\n\nRational:\n\nExplain why you have chosen this particular hypothesis and aim. This should include an explanation of why this hypothesis and aim are important and how they will contribute to the overall field of study.\n\nPrimary Proposed Analysis:\n\nOutline the methods you will use to test your hypothesis. This should include a detailed description of the experimental design, data collection procedures, and statistical methods you plan to use.\n\nAnticipated Problems and Alternative Approaches:\n\nDiscuss potential challenges that may arise during your research, as well as how you plan to address them.\nInclude contingency plans for unexpected results or complications.\nConsider possible alternative approaches or methods that could be used if the primary approach doesn’t work out.\n\nSecondary, exploratory analysis:\n\nExplain any additional analyses you plan to conduct that are not directly tied to testing your hypothesis. This could include examining relationships between variables not included in your primary analysis, or investigating unexpected findings.\nNote that while these analyses may provide interesting additional insights, they are considered exploratory because they were not part of the original research plan.\n\n\n\n\nGantt Chart\n\nUse a Gantt Chart to visualize and manage the timeline of various analytical tasks and project milestones. This allows researchers to easily see the sequence of tasks, their durations, and any dependencies between them.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nList of references"
