# Responsible Conduct of Research
Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) encompasses ethical practices and standards in scientific research, ensuring integrity, accuracy, and the consideration of societal impacts in both basic and clinical studies. It is a fundamental aspect for researchers at all levels, from students to senior faculty, essential for a thriving research career.
