title: Reading List
---

This curated list of references is an essential part of our shared knowledge base, designed to provide you with a solid foundation and a deeper understanding of the fields we are passionate about: genetic epidemiology and neurodegenerative disease. You will also find readings on other aspects of the scientific enterprise such as writing, presentations, and career development.

The references included here have been carefully selected for their relevance, clarity, and contribution to our field. They range from seminal papers that have shaped our understanding of genetic epidemiology and neurodegenerative disease, to the latest cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries of what we know. You will also find comprehensive textbooks, insightful reviews, and practical guides that cover the methodologies, tools, and techniques we use in our lab.

Whether you are a new member seeking to familiarize yourself with our field, or an experienced researcher looking to stay abreast of the latest developments, this reading list is a valuable resource. We encourage you to delve into these materials and explore the fascinating world of genetic epidemiology and neurodegenerative disease.

Remember, learning is a lifelong journey, and science is continually evolving. This reading list is not static but will be updated periodically to reflect new discoveries and advancements in our field. We also welcome your suggestions for additions to the list, as we believe that everyone in our lab can contribute to our collective learning.
