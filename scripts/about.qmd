# About the Lab

## Mission Statement
The Andrews Lab at the University of California, San Francisco, aims to transform the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Through pioneering research in genetic epidemiology, we are developing predictive risk models that will serve as the foundation for personalized medicine that improves patient care. By integrating genetic factors—such as monogenic variants, polygenic architecture, and family history—with environmental factors consisting of individual-level lifestyle & behavioral exposures and broader macro-environmental factors, our models will empower patients and healthcare providers with actionable insights. Our ultimate objective is to enable targeted, effective interventions that will improve patient outcomes and reduce health disparities in Alzheimer's disease across diverse communities.

## Lab Philosophy 
In the Andrews Lab, our philosophy serves as the cornerstone of our scientific journey, influencing both the research questions we ask and the ethical standards we uphold. Grounded in principles of scientific integrity, collaboration, innovation, and team science, we aim to cultivate an environment that promotes inclusivity, values lifelong learning, and adheres to the principles of open science. Team science is central to our ethos, reinforcing the idea that individual accomplishments are a reflection of collective effort and that our greatest achievements stem from open collaboration and mutual support. This philosophy is not merely a collection of ideals; it's a commitment to conducting research that is meaningful, ethical, and poised to make a lasting impact in the scientific community.

### Team Science
At the heart of our lab's philosophy is the concept of Team Science. We firmly believe that we are greater than the sum of our parts. In this lab, your success is everyone's success, and the same holds true in reverse. We are all collaborators here, each contributing unique skills and perspectives that enrich our collective work. I am committed to promoting not just your research, but also your professional growth, and I expect the same level of cooperation and openness from you in return. 

Collaboration is a cornerstone of our lab philosophy. We believe that the best science is done when diverse minds come together to solve complex problems. This extends to collaborations within the lab, across departments, and even internationally. We encourage lab members to engage in interdisciplinary research and to seek external collaborations that can enhance the impact of our work.

Sharing—be it materials, data, or opportunities—is a fundamental aspect of our collaborative culture. We don't see each other as competitors; we are collaborators, both within these walls and in the broader scientific community. When one of us succeeds, it's a win for all of us. Conversely, setbacks are not borne alone; we rally around each other to find solutions. 

By embracing the principles of Team Science, we aim to create a lab environment that is not just productive but also supportive, inclusive, and conducive to the personal and professional growth of all its members.

###  Scientific integrity
In the Andrews Lab, we uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity. This means conducting research that is rigorous, transparent, and ethical. We are committed to the responsible handling of data, from collection to analysis and reporting. Any form of data manipulation or scientific misconduct is unacceptable. Our aim is to contribute to the scientific community with work that can be trusted and built upon. 

**Accountability:** Accountability is a key aspect of our lab culture. Every lab member is responsible for the quality and integrity of their work, from the planning stage to publication. Regular lab meetings and internal reviews are platforms where we hold ourselves and each other accountable, ensuring that our research meets the high standards we set for ourselves. Mistakes are an inevitable part of the scientific process, and they are not setbacks but learning opportunities. The key is not in avoiding mistakes, but in how we handle them. If you encounter a problem, try to resolve it independently first. If that fails, bring it to my attention as soon as possible. There's no room for covering up errors; transparency is crucial. Together, we will work to correct the issue, learn from it, and move forward. 

**Open Science:** We are strong proponents of open science, believing that scientific knowledge is a public good. Whenever possible, we publish in open-access journals, share our data and code, and engage with the broader scientific community and the public. This commitment to openness increases the impact of our work and contributes to a more collaborative and transparent scientific community.

**Innovation and Adaptability:** In the Andrews Lab, innovation and adaptability go hand in hand as core values that drive our scientific inquiry. We encourage lab members to think creatively, question existing paradigms, and explore novel approaches to complex problems. Innovation is not confined to groundbreaking ideas but also extends to the methodologies, tools, and techniques we employ in our research.

However, more than innovation is required; the ability to adapt is equally crucial. Science is an ever-evolving field, and unexpected challenges or results are inevitable. We value adaptability as a complementary skill to innovation, enabling us to pivot our research focus or methodologies when warranted by new findings, technical advancements, or unforeseen challenges. This dual commitment to innovation and adaptability ensures that we are not only at the forefront of scientific discovery but also equipped to navigate the complexities and uncertainties that come with pioneering research.

### Lifelong Learning
Science is a constantly evolving field, and we are all perpetual students. In the Andrews Lab, we emphasize the importance of continuous learning—whether it's mastering a new research technique, staying updated on the latest literature, or developing soft skills like communication and leadership. We encourage lab members to attend conferences, workshops, and webinars, and to always be curious.

### Inclusivity and Diversity
Our lab is committed to fostering an environment where all individuals feel respected, included, and valued. We believe that diverse perspectives enrich our research and make us more effective scientists. We strive to recruit lab members from diverse backgrounds, including but not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status, and we are committed to their professional development.
