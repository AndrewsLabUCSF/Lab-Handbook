# Working in the lab

## Work Hours 
I expect all lab members to be responsible and accountable for their research projects and to set reasonable goals and expectations for themselves regarding their lab work schedule. While I encourage you to manage your time in a way that suits your personal productivity rhythms, regular attendance is beneficial for your own development as well as for the collaborative spirit of our lab. Being present and engaged helps us to work together more effectively and support one another’s research pursuits. 

Full time lab members should aim to be on-site three days per week, with two of these days being Tuesdays and Thursdays to attend lab meetings. While work hours are flexible to accommodate varying personal schedules and research needs, they should generally overlap with core business hours of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. 

However, life is full of surprises and responsibilities beyond the lab. If you foresee any changes in your availability, just let me know—open communication will help us work together to find the best solution for everyone.

## Time Off
Taking time away from the lab is an important part of leading a balanced life and can have great benefits for productivity after returning to work. All lab members are encouraged to fully utilize their entitled paid time off as stipulated in their contracts. During this time, I strongly endorse a complete break from work-related activities, including refraining from checking emails, to ensure a true break.

Lab members should inform me about their time off as early as possible, so that I can plan accordingly and ensure that lab activities continue smoothly. They can inform either in person or via email, and I would appreciate it if they could provide me with specific details about the dates and the duration of their absence. 

Currently, there are no restricted periods for taking time off. However, I ask everyone to be considerate of their own project timelines and those of collaborative efforts. Please plan your absences thoughtfully, avoiding critical phases of research when your presence may be integral to our progress.

## Code of Conduct 

All lab members are expected to adhere to the [UCSF Researcher Code of Conduct](https://compliance.ucsf.edu/ucsf-researcher-code-conduct). We are all expected to perform our research with integrity, to uphold ethical values and to demonstrate competence in our areas of research.
